# Blind Stick

The Blind Stick is an assistive IoT device designed for visually impaired people. It detects obstacles and provides feedback via vibration or LED alerts.

---

##  Features
- Obstacle detection using Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).
- Vibration motor feedback for close obstacles.
- LED alert for additional feedback.
- Arduino-based real-time response.

##  Steps
1. Connect HC-SR04 sensor to Arduino UNO.
2. Add vibration sensor for secondary input.
3. Program Arduino (`blind_stick.ino`) for distance measurement and feedback.
4. Mount sensors on a walking stick.
5. Test and calibrate detection distances.
